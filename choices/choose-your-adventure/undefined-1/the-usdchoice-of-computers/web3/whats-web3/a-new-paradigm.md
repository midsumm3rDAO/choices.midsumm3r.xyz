# A new paradigm

### In the 90s, web1 was about open protocols that were decentralized and community-governed. We had static websites, low bandwidth, and limited hardware. Most of the value accrued to **builders+users.**

****

### In the 2020s, web2 was about **centralized services run by a handful of corporations**. Social networking, AI/ML, SaaS, and the gig economy take place.



### The web3 era is now starting, **combining the community-governed and fractionalization character from web1 with the modern functionalities of web2 through cyrptonetworks (blockchains).**

****

**Cryptonetworks** are state machines that are instantiated with a genesis state and have very strict rules (_consensus_) that define how that state can transit. **No single entity controls this decentralized state machine â€” it is collectively maintained by everyone in the network**.

Our generation is creating an entirely new digital universe. Ownership and governance are becoming decentralized by design, and control is being shifted to communities. **Builders+users own pieces of services with digital tokens, both **_**non-fungible**_** and **_**fungible**_. Tokens provide property rights, governance, and ownership. We now own our own destiny.
