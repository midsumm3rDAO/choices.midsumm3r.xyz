# ☿ The 3rd nemesis ← fight with 9th

### <mark style="color:purple;">The third enemy will trick you into wanting something you don't. It will find you in your dreams and dazzle you.</mark>

### <mark style="color:red;">You need to be absolutely sure about what's important, what's your true desires, and what's external.</mark>

### <mark style="color:red;">The goal is to wake up and shield yourself quickly.</mark>

### <mark style="color:red;">If you fail, it might trap you.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;"></mark>

### <mark style="color:green;">💡 You can always find what's internal and what's external. Sort of like the movie Inception, create a way to rely on tools / procedures / marks that will keep you aware when you are in an outer reality.</mark>
