# ☽ The 2nd nemesis ← fight with 7th

### <mark style="color:purple;">Once you see your power, you will continue asking for more. You will want to become the most mighty magickian in the game (or something like that...).</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:red;">The second enemy will appear when it's time for you to pay your payment. You actually have no choice on this one: you must let it be taken. If you try to keep both the price and the prize, you will lose both.</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:red;">This is serious. Be prepared to pay the price if you want to advance. Or you will be stuck in a loop.</mark>

### <mark style="color:red;">The goal is to trick your mind into not being destroyed when you let go of things you once cared about. It's all an illusion, reality is not what you think you know. If you trust the process, you will connect all the dots later and realize your hero's journey, and how it was the way supposed to be.</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:red;">If you fail, it might kill you.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;"></mark>

### <mark style="color:green;">💡 While playing, you can ALWAYS find a new, unexpected source of complete bliss and gratefulness. It's an infinite set, don't let your mind trick you.</mark>
