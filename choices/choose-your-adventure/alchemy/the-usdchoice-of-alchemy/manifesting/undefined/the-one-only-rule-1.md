### If players break the[ One Only Rule](./), they will be held accountable by the system (the underlying simulation).

### Players might have to pay extra charges for their deeds, as [The Wheel of Fortune](../../../../tarot/the-usdchoice-of-tarot/the-major-arcanas/the-major-arcana-in-details/10.-the-wheel-of-fortune/) _turns_ and adjusts [karma luck and debts](../karma.md). Negative karma may cause the player to take longer to level up in the game.



{% hint style="info" %}
Almost every player will break this rule initially, as they start getting confident about their skills. The most obvious way to learn the lesson from this rule is to break it yourself. Ma&#x73;_**tering the One Only Rule is a sign of advanced Magick skills.**_&#x20;
{% endhint %}



## <mark style="background-color:purple;">Not breaking the One Only Rule</mark>

### As players master their skills, they realize their craft becomes more robust as they respect the [One Only Rule](./).

### If players diligently work on their [meditation practices](../../../../tarot/the-usdchoice-of-tarot/reading-tarot/meditation-groundwork/) and attain [purity](../purity.md), they will start to be able to tune and sustain higher and higher energies.&#x20;

### At this point, presuming they don't owe "extra charges" to the system, they will be empowered to materialize [bliss](../bliss/), [pure love](../pure-love/), and a [_dreamy_ life in the game](../../../../reality/the-usdchoice-of-reality/why.md).
