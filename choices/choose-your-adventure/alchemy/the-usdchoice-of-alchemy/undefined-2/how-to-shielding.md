### <mark style="color:purple;">Players may use</mark>[ artifacts and rituals](tools-for-shielding-and-tuning/) <mark style="color:purple;">to work on their shielding (such as sage, Epson salt, stones such as quartz or tourmaline, etc.).</mark>

### <mark style="color:purple;">However, their mind is what ultimately decides, creates, and maintains the shielding.</mark>&#x20;

## <mark style="color:orange;background-color:purple;">Direct recommendations</mark>



1. <mark style="color:orange;">**if you can, just cut the cord out: physically block, remove, unfollow.**</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**If you can't physically remove the influence for now, make a plan to be able to do this in the future. Do not stay in a situation that chronically attacks your well-being and your free will.**</mark>
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Realize your mind's inertia: every time this person or energy appears inside your mind, acknowledge it and then, gently, move away to your own thoughts and happy spaces.**</mark>
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Things might change later, and you might review and reshape your shielding. Don't worry about it now; protect what needs to be shielded from now.**</mark>
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Feel free to delete messaging apps from your devices as long as you need time within.**</mark>
