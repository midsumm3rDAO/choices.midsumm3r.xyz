### <mark style="color:purple;">Hacking is the act of identifying and then exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network, usually to gain unauthorized access to personal or organizational data.</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:green;">Hacking is not always a malicious activity, and the term has mostly negative connotations due to its association with cybercrime.</mark>
