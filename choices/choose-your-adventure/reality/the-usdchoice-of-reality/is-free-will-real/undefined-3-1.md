### <mark style="color:purple;">As much as classical mechanics is deterministic (the entire future and past state of a system can be determined - a la Laplace's demon), quantum mechanics allows for randomness in the outcomes of experiments due to quantum uncertainty (but we have no control over those outcomes).</mark>

### _<mark style="color:orange;">The free will theorem of John H. Conway and Simon B. Kochen states that if we have free will in the sense that our choices are not a function of the past, then, subject to certain assumptions, some elementary particles must also have free will.</mark>_
