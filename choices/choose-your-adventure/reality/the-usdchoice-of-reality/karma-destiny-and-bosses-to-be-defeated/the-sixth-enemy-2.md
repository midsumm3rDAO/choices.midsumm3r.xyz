### <mark style="color:purple;">At this point, there are no more excuses. Your mental strength will be tested to the limit. Days might last centuries or just few minutes. Inexplicable events. Clarity. Access to past, present, future knowledge. Unbearable and yet perfect power. Infinite bliss.</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">But one mistake, one moment of mental weakness, and you lose your stand to a lower state (however, recovery can be quick).</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">Mastering shielding is essential. NPCs will try to eat your energy (it looks yummy, it's almost not their fault). You need to cut all the chords, as they are liabilities. You can't advance until you master "protecting your essential coins" (and this DOES mean giving up the non-essential coins).</mark>

### <mark style="color:blue;">You feel so close, you can feel all the fantastic possibilities. But until you master the reliance needed to access all the power in this stage, you won't be able to maintain the state. This is a dangerous level. You are beyond (almost) every frequency.</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">Master temperance and keep every atom of your being pure. Infinite bliss and power are just around the corner.</mark>
