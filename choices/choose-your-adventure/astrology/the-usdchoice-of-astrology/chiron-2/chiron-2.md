## <mark style="color:blue;">Lots are mathematical calculations in a</mark> [<mark style="color:blue;">THC</mark>](../the-hubble-chart-thc/the-hubble-chart-thc/) <mark style="color:blue;">and are relevant for hacking certain outcomes in this reality.</mark>

For example, to calculate the **Lot of Fortune**:

1. Determine the sign and degree of the Ascendant (the team you play)
2. Find the position of the Moon.
3. Find the position of the Sun.

The Lot of Fortune is then calculated as follows (in terms of degrees):

$$Lot of Fortune=Ascendant+Moon−Sun$$

The resulting degree and sign represent the chart's Lot of Fortune.

## <mark style="color:blue;">The term “lots” comes from Platos’s myth of creation in The Republic, where one’s fate was determined through divinatory means.</mark>
