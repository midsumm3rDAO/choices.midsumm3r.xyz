**In** [**Astronomy**](../../../astrophysics/)**, an exact science, calculations are always done considering no privileged (absolute) framework in the entire Universe (per** [**Einstein's Theory of Relativity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory\_of\_relativity)**).**&#x20;

**In** [**Astrology**](../../)**, a (still) non-exact science, calculations are always done by looking at the projection of how the Solar System and the main constellations interplay with us on Earth. From our viewpoint, the Sun (and other "**[**planets**](../planets/)**") appears to travel around us, crossing each of the 12 constellations in their way.**
