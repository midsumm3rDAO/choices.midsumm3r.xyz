### _<mark style="color:purple;">**"I haven‚Äôt yet received THE ASTROLOGICAL MAGAZINE, but I will answer your letter nevertheless.**</mark>_

### _<mark style="color:purple;">**Since you want to know my opinion about astrology I can tell you that I‚Äôve been interested in this particular activity of the human mind since more than 30 years.**</mark>_

### _<mark style="color:purple;">**As I am a psychologist, I am chiefly interested in the particular light the horoscope sheds on certain complications in the character. In cases of difficult psychological diagnosis I usually get a horoscope in order to have a further point of view from an entirely different angle.**</mark>_

### _<mark style="color:purple;">**I must say that I very often found that the astrological data elucidated certain points which I otherwise would have been unable to understand. From such experiences I formed the opinion that astrology is of particular interest to the psychologist, since it contains a sort of psychological experience which we call ‚Äúprojected‚Äù ‚Äî this means that we find the psychological facts as it were in the constellations.**</mark>_

### _<mark style="color:purple;">**This originally gave rise to the idea that these factors derive from the stars, whereas they are merely in a relation of synchronicity with them.**</mark>_

### _<mark style="color:purple;">**I admit that this is a very curious fact which throws a peculiar light on the structure of the human mind.**</mark>_

### _<mark style="color:purple;">**What I miss in astrological literature is chiefly the statistical method by which certain fundamental facts could be scientifically established."**</mark>_

### <mark style="color:purple;">**- Dr. CG Jung**</mark>
